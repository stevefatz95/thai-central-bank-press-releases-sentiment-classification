Inflation remains subdued from supply factors and government subsidies and is projected to gradually increase towards the target range by the end of 2024.,1
"The aforementioned downside factors are expected to subside this year, causing the Thai economy to grow at 2.6 and 3.0 percent in 2024 and 2025, respectively, faster relative to the previous year.",1
"However, some groups of SMEs and low-income households face tighter credit conditions due to financial access difficulties and debt serviceability deterioration due to a slower rebound in income.",-1
The Committee will continue to closely monitor the volatilities in the foreign exchange market.,0
The Committee voted 5 to 2 to maintain the policy rate at 2.50 percent.,0

"Structural impediments, particularly deteriorating competitiveness in the exports and manufacturing sectors, as well as global excess capacity limit the benefits of the global economic recovery on the Thai economy.",-1

"Under the monetary policy framework with objectives of maintaining price stability, supporting sustainable and full-potential economic growth, and preserving financial stability, the Committee judges that the Thai economic recovery will continue to gain traction, and thus the extraordinarily accommodative monetary policy will become less needed.",1

"On exchange rates, the baht has depreciated relative to the US dollar in line with regional currencies.",0
Overall financial system remains resilient.,1
The Committee voted 4 to 3 to maintain the policy rate at 0.50 percent.,0
Inflation will exceed the upper bound of the target range in 2022 due to increasing domestic energy prices and higher cost passthrough that have broadened into wider ranges of products.,-1
"Meanwhile, the impact of COVID-19 and the conflict between Russia and Ukraine on the Thai economy will be limited.",1
"Headline inflation would increase and remain elevated for longer than previously estimated, due to the increase in oil prices and higher cost passthrough.",-1
"Furthermore, the labor market and household income show signs of improvement as economic activities continue to expand in tandem with the relaxation of containment measures.",1
"The Committee views that financial institutions should continue with debt restructuring in a sustainable manner to have broader impacts and be consistent with borrowers’ long-term debt serviceability, especially with a focus on targeted measures for vulnerable groups.",1
"Liquidity in the financial system remains ample, although liquidity distribution still varies across economic sectors.",0
"Meanwhile, three members view that policy normalization is warranted in this meeting given the increased upside risks to both growth and inflation.",0
"The Committee assesses that the Thai economy will expand at 3.3 percent in 2022 and 4.2 percent in 2023 on the back of better-than-expected recovery in domestic consumption, especially in the services sector.",1
The Committee assesses that the Thai economy will continue to recover and could expand faster than previously expected owing to stronger domestic demand and the pickup in foreign tourists.,1
Overall financial conditions remain accommodative albeit volatilities increase in financial markets.,0
The Committee will assess the appropriate timing for a gradual policy normalization in accordance with the shift in the outlook and risks surrounding growth and inflation.,0
Some households and businesses remain vulnerable to rising living and production costs as their incomes have not fully recovered in addition to their high levels of debt.,-1
The overall financial conditions tightened somewhat.,-1
"However, the recovery has been uneven across sectors, with certain merchandise exports, manufacturing production, as well as SMEs facing pressure from structural impediments.",-1
"Meanwhile, headline Inflation is projected to gradually return towards the target range by the end of 2024.",1
"Credit quality deteriorated, partly due to debtors who have previously received financial assistances as well as SMEs and vulnerable households experiencing slower income recovery and elevated debt burden.",-1
The baht appreciated against the U.S. dollar in response to monetary policies in major advanced economies as well as domestic factors.,1
"The Committee voted 5 to 2 to cut the policy rate by 0.25 percentage point from 2.50 to 2.25 percent, effective immediately.",-1
Private sector funding costs via commercial banks and corporate bond markets remain relatively stable.,0
"Moreover, it should not be at too low a level that would create build-ups of financial imbalances in the long term.",-1
The Committee deems that a neutral stance of policy rate remains appropriate with the economic growth and inflation outlook.,1
Two members voted to maintain the policy rate at 2.50 percent.,0
"Panyanukul, Secretary of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), announced the outcome of the meeting on 16 October 2024 as follows.",0
"Raw food inflation is likely to rise due to volatile weather conditions, while energy inflation is expected to increase because of the base effect.",-1
"The prevailing monetary policy framework seeks to maintain price stability, support sustainable growth, and preserve financial stability.",1
"The main drivers are tourism, private consumption that is further supported by government stimulus measures, and improvement in exports given higher demand for electronics.",1
The overall Thai economy is projected to expand as anticipated.,1
Medium-term inflation expectations remain consistent with target.,1
Headline inflation is anticipated to gradually return to the target range by the end of 2024.,1
The Committee deems that the policy rate should remain neutral and consistent with economic potential.,0
"Moreover, the Committee deems it crucial to monitor the impact of deteriorating credit quality on funding costs and overall credit growth, as well as their implications on real economic activities.",-1
Most members thus voted to cut the policy rate by 0.25 percentage point to alleviate debt-servicing burden for borrowers.,1
"Headline inflation is projected at 0.5 and 1.2 percent for 2024 and 2025, respectively.",0
"The Committee supports the Bank of Thailand’s policy to facilitate debt restructuring through financial institutions, viewing it as a targeted debt measure that aids the household debt deleveraging process.",1
"Two members voted to maintain the policy interest rate, deeming that it is consistent with the economic and inflation outlook, and to stress the importance of long-term macro-financial stability as well as to preserve policy space amid ongoing uncertainties.",0
"Moreover, the lower policy rate would not impede debt deleveraging given the expected slowdown in loan growth and would remain neutral and consistent with economic potential.",1
"Business loans growth declined, especially loans to SMEs, businesses facing structural impediments, as well as hire purchase and credit card loans.",-1
"The Thai economy is projected to expand at rates close to the previous assessment at 2.7 and 2.9 percent in 2024 and 2025, respectively.",0
The deleveraging process is expected to continue.,0
"Core inflation is forecast at 0.5 percent and 0.9 percent in 2024 and 2025, respectively, and is expected to remain low due partly to structural factors such as heightened competition from imported goods.",1
"The Committee assessed that the Thai economy would continue to recover, as the Omicron variant would exert limited pressure on the public health system.",1
"On exchange rates, the baht relative to the US dollar still exhibited volatile movements due to faster monetary policy normalization in advanced economies and the easing of domestic outbreak containment measures.",-1
"The Committee would closely monitor key factors affecting the economic outlook, namely, developments of the COVID-19 outbreak, global energy prices, higher cost pass-through, as well as the adequacy of fiscal, financial, and credit measures.",0
The Committee would monitor developments of the labor market as well as the impact of higher living costs given that income had not fully recovered.,0
Monetary policy should contribute to continued accommodative financial conditions overall.,0
"Under the monetary policy framework with objectives of maintaining price stability, supporting sustainable and full-potential economic growth, and preserving financial stability, the Committee continued to put emphasis on supporting the economic recovery.",1
"Nevertheless, the average inflation rate for the full year 2022 and medium-term inflation expectations would remain within the target range.",1
"Upside inflationary risks increased, and headline inflation would accelerate in early 2022 owing to the rises in energy and raw food prices.",-1
The Committee viewed that the government measures and policy coordination among government agencies would be critical to support the economic recovery.,1
"In particular, cost pass-through from producers to consumer prices could increase if energy and raw food prices remain elevated for longer than expected, or if the supply constraint problems broaden into other goods.",-1
"Meanwhile, upside risks to inflation increased.",-1
"Furthermore, there had not been an indication of broad-based increases in the prices of goods and services, while demand-side inflationary pressures remained subdued.",1
"In addition, the ongoing financial and fiscal measures, with the focus on rebuilding and enhancing potential growth, would play an important part in bolstering the robust recovery of the labor market as well as the income of businesses and households.",1
"These measures included the special loan facility, asset warehousing scheme, and other measures by specialized financial institutions (SFIs).",0
Long-term Thai government bond yields rose primarily in tandem with US Treasury yields.,0
"Fiscal measures should support the economic recovery in a targeted manner, with a focus on generating income and expediting measures to rebuild and enhance potential growth.",1
"Overall liquidity remained ample, but liquidity distribution still varied across economic sectors.",0
"However, there remained a need to closely monitor developments of the pandemic going forward.",0
The Committee voted unanimously to maintain the policy rate at 0.50 percent.,0
Financial and credit measures helped distribute liquidity to the affected groups in a targeted manner and reduce debt burden.,1
"The Committee viewed that the continued accommodative monetary policy would help support economic growth, and thus voted to maintain the policy rate.",1
"This would be owing to price increases in certain sectors, especially energy and raw food products.",-1
Headline inflation in 2022 would be higher than previously assessed and could exceed the target range in the early part of the year.,-1
"The Committee assessed that the Thai economy in 2021 would expand faster than previously projected, and the recovery would continue into 2022 driven by higher merchandise exports, as well as a higher number of foreign tourist arrivals due to faster-than-expected relaxation of travel restrictions.",1
"The Committee would closely monitor developments in both global and domestic financial markets, and continue to expedite the new foreign exchange ecosystem, particularly through supporting SMEs in hedging against risks from exchange rate volatility.",0
The Committee would stand ready to use appropriate monetary policy tools if necessary.,0
Public health measures should strike a balance between containing the outbreak and supporting the recovery of economic activities.,0
"While demand-side inflationary pressures remained subdued in line with the gradual recovery of household income, there remained a need to monitor global energy prices and broad-based cost pass-through to goods and services.",0
"However, the recovery would remain fragile and uneven across sectors, especially in tourism which was below pre-pandemic levels.",0
"Disyatat, Secretary of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), announced the outcome of the meeting on 9 February 2022 as follows.",0
"In the period ahead, there remained a need to closely monitor developments of global energy prices and domestic goods and services prices, as well as the possibility of growing wage pressures.",0
Downside risk to growth improved.,1
"In addition, financial institutions should accelerate debt consolidation and debt restructuring in a sustainable manner through the scheme launched on September 3, 2021 to have broader impacts and be consistent with borrowers’ long-term debt serviceability.",1
The Committee recognizes the heightened uncertainty going forward and deems it necessary to monitor economic growth and inflation outlook in deliberating monetary policy going forward.,0
"The Thai economy is projected to expand by 2.7 and 2.9 percent in 2024 and 2025, respectively.",1
"The Committee deems it necessary to monitor credit growth developments and the implications for economic activities, as well as the impact of the government’s “Khun Soo, Rao Chuay” program in helping alleviate debt burden for fragile groups in a targeted manner.",0
"For example, developments in the automotive industry have been adversely affected by both price and demand factors.",-1
Credit growth for sectors such as tourism and services decelerated from debt repayments and increased in income.,0
"The Committee voted to maintain the policy rate, deeming the current rate is consistent with the economic trajectory close to potential, inflation moving towards the target range, and safeguarding long-term macro-financial stability, together with preserving policy space amid increasing uncertainties going forward.",0
"The Committee will keep monitoring global financial markets development, which is likely to be volatile due to major economies’ policies, and its impact on Thailand’s financial markets.",0
"However, the economic recovery remained uneven across sectors.",-1
Energy inflation is projected to remain low given global crude oil prices.,1
The Thai economy faces challenges from increased competition from external factors and heightened uncertainties especially from major economies’ policy going forward.,-1
"The recent slowdown in credit is due to the decrease in investment demand for some business sectors, debt repayments for loans borrowed during COVID-19, and credit risks that remain heightened.",-1
"Tourism and domestic demand continue to be the main drivers, as well as exports of electronics and machinery in line with the expected recovery in the global technology cycle.",1
"Core inflation is forecasted to be at 0.6 and 1.0 percent in 2024 and 2025, respectively, in tandem with the economic outlook and cost passthrough for food items.",0
"The prevailing monetary policy framework seeks to maintain price stability, support sustainable growth, and preserve financial stability.",1
"The baht depreciated against the U.S. dollar since the previous meeting, due to the adjustments in Fed funds rate expectations.",-1
"Tourism related services continue to improve, while recovery for manufacturing production slows especially businesses facing pressures from declining competitiveness.",0
This resulted in uneven income recovery for households.,-1
"Overall, medium-term inflation expectations remain consistent with the target.",1
The Committee voted unanimously to maintain the policy rate at 2.25 percent.,0
"Meanwhile, credit growth for SMEs in manufacturing industries that faced increased competition declined in line with heightened credit risks.",-1
"Headline inflation is expected to be at 0.4 and 1.1 percent in 2024 and 2025, respectively.",0
"Whereas tourism-related services improved, the recovery for SMEs and certain manufacturing industries faced pressures from declining competitiveness.",0
"However, overall economic projections remain close to the previous assessment.",0
"Panyanukul, Secretary of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), announced the outcome of the meeting on 18 December 2024 as follows.",0
"Looking forward, major economies’ policies remain highly uncertain, so it is critical to monitor such developments which could affect merchandise exports and private investment for Thailand going forward.",-1
"Meanwhile, Thai government bond yields declined in line with the previous policy rate cut.",0
The Committee would stand ready to use additional appropriate monetary policy tools if necessary.,0
"Nonetheless, the special loan facility for businesses helped enhance credit access for SMEs.",1
"The labor market would be more fragile, particularly the services sector and the self-employed.",-1
The Committee would closely monitor developments in both global and domestic financial markets and continue to expedite the new foreign exchange ecosystem.,0
"Nevertheless, two members voted to cut the policy rate to support other measures in shoring up the economy and mitigate heightened risks in the period ahead.",-1
"Mallikamas, Secretary of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), announced the outcome of the meeting on 4 August 2021 as follows.",0
The Committee assessed that the Thai economy in 2021 would be affected by the COVID-19 outbreak more than expected with significant downside risks.,-1
Public health measures should aim at accelerating the procurement and distribution of effective vaccines to prevent the outbreak from being prolonged.,0
One MPC member was unable to attend the meeting.,0
"On exchange rates, the Thai baht relative to the US dollar depreciated more than regional currencies owing to domestic factors.",-1
The Committee viewed that risks to the economic outlook remained high.,-1
"However, the economy would be supported by higher public expenditure thanks to the Emergency Decree Authorizing the Ministry of Finance to Raise Additional Loans to Solve Economic and Social problems as Affected by the Coronavirus Disease Pandemic, BE 2564 (2021).",1
The support must be provided by accelerating the distribution of liquidity and reduce debt burden for those who were affected.,1
"Headline inflation would be largely unchanged, while medium-term inflation expectations remained anchored within the target.",1
Downside risks to the economic outlook remained significant from the possibility of the outbreak situation in Thailand and other countries becoming more severe.,-1
"These measures included the special loan facility, asset warehousing scheme, and other measures by specialized financial institutions (SFIs).",1
Fiscal and financial measures must be expedited to assist affected groups in a more targeted and timely manner in line with the current situation.,1
"Under the monetary policy framework with objectives of maintaining price stability, supporting sustainable and full-potential economic growth, and preserving financial stability, the Committee continued to put emphasis on supporting the economic recovery.",1
The Committee would closely monitor these risks which would affect private consumption as well as income and employment in addition to impacts on foreign tourist figures.,0
"The support would also come from the improving merchandise exports, although parts of the manufacturing sector were affected by the outbreak in factories and temporary shortages in raw material.",0
The Thai economy was projected to expand 0.7 and 3.7 percent in 2021 and 2022 respectively.,0
Financial and credit measures should be adjusted quickly to enhance effectiveness in order to expedite the distribution of liquidity to the affected groups in a targeted manner and help reduce debt burden.,1
Fiscal measures should help alleviate the adverse impacts and support the economy by more actively addressing vulnerabilities in the labor market and business sector in an adequate and timely manner.,1
Two members voted to cut the policy rate by 0.25 percentage point.,0
Monetary policy must contribute to continued accommodative financial conditions overall.,1
"In addition, the Committee would monitor key factors affecting the economic outlook, namely the distribution and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines, the outbreak situation in Thailand and abroad, as well as the adequacy of fiscal, financial, and credit measures.",0
"In addition, financial institutions should accelerate debt restructuring to have broader impacts and be consistent with borrowers’ long-term debt serviceability.",0
The Committee viewed that the government measures and policy coordination among government agencies would be critical to support the economic recovery.,1
Most members viewed that financial measures would be more effective than a further reduction in the policy rate which was already low.,1
The Committee voted 4 to 2 to maintain the policy rate at 0.50 percent.,0
"Despite ample overall liquidity, the distribution of liquidity remained uneven due to increased credit risks, particularly among SMEs and households that were additionally impacted by the third wave of the COVID-19 outbreak.",-1
Most members thus voted to maintain the policy rate.,0
This would be lower than the previous projection due to private consumption which was greatly affected this year and foreign tourist figures which were expected to be significantly lower next year.,-1
The most important issue for the Thai economy at present was to accelerate containment of the outbreak and distribution of vaccines to restore confidence and support the recovery in economic activities and income.,0
The Thai economy was projected to expand by 1.8 and 3.9 percent in 2021 and 2022 respectively.,1
"On exchange rates, the Thai baht relative to the US dollar depreciated more than regional currencies.",-1
The Bank of Thailand would closely monitor the progress and assess the efficacy of financial and credit measures.,0
"Meanwhile, higher inflation in advanced economies and global supply shortages would have limited impact on domestic inflation.",1
Fiscal measures would play a crucial role in driving the economic recovery amid high uncertainties.,0
"In addition, financial institutions should accelerate debt restructuring.",0
"Despite ample overall liquidity, the distribution of liquidity remained uneven due to increased credit risks, particularly among SMEs and households that were additionally impacted by the third wave of the COVID-19 outbreak.",-1
"The labor market would be more fragile and recover slowly, particularly the service sectors and the self-employed.",-1
"Mallikamas, Secretary of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), announced the outcome of the meeting on 23 June 2021 as follows.",0
Headline inflation would temporarily increase in the second quarter of 2021 due to the low level of crude oil prices in the same quarter of last year.,0
Medium-term inflation expectations remained anchored within the target.,1
The Committee would closely monitor these risks which would affect foreign tourist figures as well as domestic economic activities.,0
Short-term measures to accelerate the procurement and distribution of vaccines would prevent the outbreak from being prolonged.,1
"Thus, the government should accelerate the disbursement of relief and other fiscal support measures to provide adequate and continuous economic stimulus as well as address vulnerabilities in the labor market.",1
"The Committee viewed that financial measures, particularly special loan facility for businesses as well as debt restructuring, should be expedited.",0
The Committee assessed that the Thai economic recovery would be slower and more uneven than the previous forecast due to the third wave of the COVID-19 outbreak.,-1
"In addition, the Committee would monitor key factors affecting the economic outlook, namely the distribution and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines, the possibility of the outbreak situation in Thailand and abroad becoming more severe owing to virus mutations, as well as the adequacy of fiscal, financial, and credit measures.",0
"The new financial rehabilitation measures to support business recovery post-COVID-19 and other measures by specialized financial institutions (SFIs) should accelerate the distribution of liquidity to the affected groups in a targeted manner, reduce debt burden, and support the economic recovery.",1
The Committee voted unanimously to maintain the policy rate at 0.50 percent.,0
"These measures would reduce financial burden for the businesses and households affected by the outbreak in a more targeted manner than cutting the policy rate, which was already at a low level.",1
Downside risks to the economic outlook also remained significant from the new wave of the outbreak.,-1
This would be lower than the previous projection owing to lower foreign tourist figures and domestic demand held down by the third wave of the outbreak.,-1
The Committee viewed that the continuity of government measures and policy coordination among government agencies would be critical to support the economic recovery impacted by the new outbreak.,1
The Committee would stand ready to use additional appropriate monetary policy tools if necessary.,0
Downside risks to the economic outlook also remained significant from the possibility of the outbreak situation in Thailand and abroad becoming more severe owing to virus mutations.,-1
"However, the economy would be supported by higher public expenditure thanks to the Emergency Decree Authorizing the Ministry of Finance to Raise Additional Loans to Solve Economic and Social Problems as Affected by the Coronavirus Disease Pandemic, BE 2564 (2021) as well as by the improving merchandise exports in line with the global economic recovery.",1
"Meanwhile, monetary policy must remain accommodative.",1
The Committee would closely monitor developments in both the global and domestic financial markets and continue to expedite the new foreign exchange ecosystem.,0
Long-term government bond yields remained stable.,1
The Committee thus voted to maintain the policy rate at this meeting and stand ready to use the limited policy space at the most effective timing.,0
"Under the monetary policy framework with objectives of maintaining price stability, supporting sustainable and full-potential economic growth, and preserving financial stability, the Committee continued to put emphasis on supporting the economic recovery.",1
Risks to growth outlook increase from potential delay in merchandise export recovery and domestic political uncertainties.,-1
"Inflation declined and is projected to stabilize within the target range, subject to upside risks.",1
"The baht fluctuated with the US monetary policy expectations, the Chinese economic outlook, and domestic political uncertainties.",-1
Upside inflationary risks stem from higher food prices amid a more severe El Nino episode which could accelerate cost pass-through in the context of continuing economic expansion.,-1
"The Thai economy should continue to expand, driven mainly by tourism and private consumption.",1
"The Committee voted unanimously to raise the policy rate by 0.25 percentage point from 2.00 to 2.25 percent, effective immediately.",0
"Private sector funding costs increased consistent with the policy rate, while the slowing private credit growth partly reflected a normalization of lending activity after an uninterrupted credit expansion throughout the COVID-19 crisis.",-1
The overall financial system remains resilient.,1
"Core inflation edged lower, but should stabilize at a higher level than in the past.",0
"Against such backdrop, monetary policy should continue to ensure that inflation stays sustainably within the target range as well as give due consideration to macro-financial stability in the longer term.",1
Overall financial conditions became less accommodative but remain supportive of fund mobilization by the private sector and the ongoing economic recovery.,1
"Disyatat, Secretary of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), announced the outcome of the meeting on 2 August 2023 as follows.",0
"Merchandise exports contracted in the short term partly due to subdued demand from China and global electronic cycle, but should pick up looking ahead as the global economic activity gathers momentum.",1
"External demand softened somewhat in the near term, but is expected to gradually recover looking ahead.",1
The Committee therefore voted to raise the policy rate by 0.25 percentage point at this meeting.,0
Financial institutions maintain high levels of capital and loan loss provision.,1
"Inflation is expected to stabilize within the target range, with upside risks that still warrant monitoring.",0
"In the context of continuing economic expansion and narrowing slack, monetary policy should keep inflation sustainably within the target range and foster longer-term macro-financial stability by preempting the buildup of financial imbalances that could arise in a low-for-long interest rate environment.",1
"Credit quality might deteriorate for some fragile SMEs and households with impaired debt serviceability, higher debt burden, and slower income recovery.",-1
"The Committee supports the continuation of debt restructuring measures as well as targeted measures and sustainable debt resolution for vulnerable groups, particularly responsible lending measures.",1
"Headline inflation declined from energy prices, cost-of-living subsidies, and high base last year, but should rebound in the second half of this year after the effects of temporary factors dissipate.",0
The Thai economy overall continued to recover.,1
"In deliberating further policy rate increases looking ahead, the Committee will take into account economic and inflation outlook as well as associated risk assessments.",0
A higher policy rate would also help preserve the policy space in light of the highly uncertain outlook.,0
"Under the prevailing monetary policy framework, the Committee seeks to maintain price stability, support sustainable growth in line with potential, and preserve financial stability.",1
"In view of these objectives, the Committee expects a continuing economic expansion and narrowing slack.",1
The Committee viewed that government measures should be expedited to support the economic recovery.,1
"Under the monetary policy framework with objectives of maintaining price stability, supporting sustainable and full-potential economic growth, and preserving financial stability, the Committee continued to put emphasis on supporting the economic recovery.",1
The labor market improved from higher income of workers in the services sector and the self-employed in line with economic acitivities.,1
"In addition, financial institutions should accelerate debt restructuring to have broader impacts and be consistent with borrowers’ long-term debt serviceability.",1
"Mallikamas, Secretary of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), announced the outcome of the meeting on 29 September 2021 as follows.",0
Financial and credit measures should be expedited to distribute liquidity to the affected groups in a targeted manner and help reduce debt burden.,1
"Nonetheless, progress on vaccination and earlier-than-expected relaxation of the containment measures would help support the economy in the period ahead.",1
The Thai economy would still be highly uncertain.,-1
Public health measures should strike a balance between containing the outbreak and supporting the recovery of economic activities and income.,1
"In addition, factors affecting the economic outlook, namely the Committee would monitor key implementation and relaxation of the domestic containment measures as well as the adequacy of fiscal, financial, and credit measures.",0
Monetary policy must contribute to continued accommodative financial conditions overall.,1
"Foreign tourist figures were expected to recover slowly, while merchandise exports would continue to be affected by shortages of containers and semiconductors.",-1
"Nonetheless, headline inflation forecast and medium-term inflation expectations remained anchored within the target.",1
"The Thai economy was projected to expand 0.7 and 3.9 percent in 2021 and 2022 respectively, largely unchanged from the August projection.",0
"On exchange rates, the baht relative to the US dollar exhibited more volatile movements owing to developments of monetary policy in advanced economies and uncertainties in the Thai economic recovery outlook.",-1
"The Committee viewed that financial measures would be more effective than a further reduction in the policy rate, which was already low, and thus voted to maintain the policy rate.",0
"Despite some progress on financial measures, liquidity distribution and debt restructuring should be expedited further for those who were affected.",0
"Nonetheless, the special loan facility for businesses helped enhance credit access for SMEs.",1
"Despite ample overall liquidity, the distribution of liquidity remained uneven due to increased credit risks, particularly among SMEs and households.",-1
The Committee voted unanimously to maintain the policy rate at 0.50 percent.,0
The most important issue for the Thai economy at present was the implementation of public health measures that would help facilitate the economic and income recovery.,1
Fiscal measures should help facilitate the economic recovery by emphasizing on generating income and preparing measures to raise potential growth.,1
The Committee viewed that the government measures and policy coordination among government agencies would be critical to support the economic recovery.,1
The Committee would closely monitor developments in both global and domestic financial markets and continue to expedite the new foreign exchange ecosystem.,0
"Thus, there remained a need to monitor the development in the outbreak and relaxation of containment measures, private sector confidence, as well as the momentum of government measures as these factors would affect the economic recovery going forward.",0
The economy in 2022 would gradually recover mainly owing to domestic spending in tandem with improving confidence.,1
"Although the economy in the third quarter of 2021 was affected by the containment measures and a slowdown in exports, significant progress on vaccination and earlier-than-expected relaxation of the containment measures would help restore private sector confidence and boost private consumption for the rest of 2021.",1
"The Committee assessed that the Thai economy in 2021 and 2022 would expand close to the projection from the previous meeting, but uncertainties surrounding the economic outlook remained high.",0
The Committee would stand ready to use additional appropriate monetary policy tools if necessary.,0
"These measures included the special loan facility, asset warehousing scheme, and other measures by specialized financial institutions (SFIs).",0
Headline inflation would remain subdued in line with weak domestic demand.,0
"In addition, the Committee would monitor key factors affecting the economic outlook, namely the outbreak situation following the re-opening of the country, the adequacy of fiscal, financial, and credit measures, and the global energy price pass-through.",0
"In addition, financial institutions should accelerate debt restructuring in a sustainable manner through the scheme launched on September 3, 2021 to have broader impacts and be consistent with borrowers’ long-term debt serviceability.",0
"Merchandise exports would decelerate in tandem with growth in trading partner economies, while foreign tourist figures were expected to recover slowly.",-1
"Overall liquidity remained ample but credit risks remained a challenge to liquidity distribution, particularly to SMEs and households.",0
"On exchange rates, the baht relative to the US dollar exhibited more volatile movements owing to monetary policy in advanced economies and uncertainties in the Thai economic recovery outlook.",-1
Government bond yields increased in tandem with those of developed markets.,0
The Committee voted unanimously to maintain the policy rate at 0.50 percent.,0
"Meanwhile, the labor market improved from higher income of workers in the services sector and the self-employed in line with economic activities.",1
The special loan facility for businesses helped in part alleviate the problem.,1
"Nevertheless, headline inflation would remain within the target, with upside risks including the elevated global energy prices persisting longer than expected and global supply constraints becoming more prolonged.",-1
"However, the slow recovery of income and purchasing power would lead to subdued demand-side inflationary pressures.",-1
"Thus, there remained a need to monitor the outbreak situation following the re-opening of the country, the momentum of fiscal support, and the pass-through of global energy prices, as these factors would affect the economic recovery going forward.",0
"The Thai economy would expand at a pace close to the previous projection for 2021 and 2022 on the back of domestic spending that gradually recovered following the relaxation of containment measures, partially offsetting the adverse impact of higher global energy prices.",1
The Committee assessed that the Thai economy had bottomed out in the third quarter of 2021 and entered the recovery phase following the relaxation of containment measures and the re-opening of the country.,1
Public health measures should strike a balance between containing the outbreak and supporting the recovery of economic activities particularly after the re-opening of the country.,1
The Committee would stand ready to use additional appropriate monetary policy tools if necessary.,0
The Committee viewed that the government measures and policy coordination among government agencies would be critical to support the economic recovery.,1
"Disyatat, Secretary of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), announced the outcome of the meeting on 10 November 2021 as follows.",0
"However, the fragile recovery would remain subject to uncertainties.",-1
The fragile economic recovery outlook would still be subject to uncertainties.,-1
"Meanwhile, downside risks to the economic projection decreased on account of the accelerated vaccination progress.",1
"The Committee viewed that the continued accommodative monetary policy would help support overall economic growth, and thus voted to maintain the policy rate.",0
"The Committee would closely monitor developments in both global and domestic financial markets, and continue to expedite the new foreign exchange ecosystem, particularly through supporting SMEs in hedging against risks from exchange rate volatility.",1
Headline inflation increased temporarily mainly due to the global energy prices.,-1
"Headline inflation would increase temporarily owing to supply-side factors, particularly the energy prices which would likely decline by early next year.",0
"Looking ahead, fiscal support would decline following the substantial stimulus earlier.",-1
"In addition, the ongoing financial and fiscal measures, with the focus on rebuilding and enhancing potential growth would play an important part in bolstering the robust recovery of income.",1
"Meanwhile, medium-term inflation expectations remained anchored within the target.",1
Monetary policy should contribute to continued accommodative financial conditions overall.,1
"Under the monetary policy framework with objectives of maintaining price stability, supporting sustainable and full-potential economic growth, and preserving financial stability, the Committee continued to put emphasis on supporting the economic recovery.",1
"These measures included the special loan facility, asset warehousing scheme, and other measures by specialized financial institutions (SFIs).",0
Financial and credit measures should be expedited to distribute liquidity to the affected groups in a targeted manner and help reduce debt burden.,1
Fiscal measures should be more targeted in facilitating the economic recovery by focusing on generating income and expediting measures to rebuild and enhance potential growth.,1
The Committee is monitoring additional impetus to growth and inflation from government economic policies.,0
"Growth should however pick up in 2024 from domestic demand, underpinned by a steady tourism recovery and a turnaround in merchandise exports, with additional support from government policies.",1
Financial institutions maintain high levels of capital and loan loss provision.,1
Overall financial conditions tightened somewhat but remain supportive of fund mobilization by the private sector and the ongoing economic recovery.,0
"In deliberating monetary policy going forward, the Committee will take into account growth and inflation outlook, including upside risks from government economic policies.",0
"The Thai economy overall continued to recover in 2023, albeit at a slower pace due to soft external demand.",0
"The Committee is attentive to the upside risks to inflation, stemming from possible demand-side pressures related to government economic policies and higher food prices should the El Niño phenomenon intensify.",-1
"Growth should pick up in 2024, supported by both domestic and global demand.",1
"In the context of continuing expansion and narrowing slack, monetary policy should aim to keep inflation sustainably within the target range, foster long-term macro-financial stability, and ensure sufficient policy space given uncertain outlook.",1
"Financial markets volatility picked up, with rising bond yields and baht depreciation against the US dollar, influenced by US monetary policy and as market participants awaited details on government policies which may have macroeconomic and fiscal sustainability implications.",-1
"Meanwhile, core inflation should pick up from 1.4 in 2023 to 2.0 percent in 2024.",0
The overall financial system remains resilient.,1
"Under the prevailing monetary policy framework, the Committee seeks to maintain price stability, support sustainable growth in line with potential, and preserve financial stability.",1
Government living-cost subsidies and a high base last year would keep inflation low for the rest of 2023.,1
Private sector funding costs increased consistent with the policy rate.,0
"Disyatat, Secretary of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), announced the outcome of the meeting on 27 September 2023 as follows.",0
"The Committee projects growth to be 2.8 and 4.4 percent in 2023 and 2024, respectively, driven by private consumption.",1
"In pursuit of these objectives and having normalized policy gradually up to the current meeting, the Committee deems the current policy interest rate to be appropriate for supporting long-term sustainable growth.",1
The Committee thus voted to raise the policy rate by 0.25 percentage point at this meeting.,0
"Growth this year softened somewhat from a delayed recovery in merchandise exports and tourism, weighed by subdued growth in China and the global electronic cycle.",-1
"Headline inflation is projected to remain within the target range, at 1.6 and 2.6 percent in 2023 and 2024, respectively.",1
"The slowing private credit growth partly reflected a normalization of lending activity after the crisis-era expansion, and should improve as the recovery gathers momentum.",0
"There is a need to continue monitoring credit quality for some SMEs and households with impaired debt serviceability, higher debt burden, and slower income recovery.",-1
Inflation is projected to increase next year in line with the recovery and El Niño-related supply pressure.,-1
"The Committee supports the continuation of debt restructuring measures as well as targeted measures and sustainable debt resolution for vulnerable groups, particularly responsible lending measures.",1
"The Committee voted unanimously to raise the policy rate by 0.25 percentage point from 2.25 to 2.50 percent, effective immediately.",0
"The Committee deems that a continuing gradual policy normalization is an appropriate course for monetary policy consistent with the growth and inflation outlook, and thus votes to raise the policy rate by 0.25 percentage point at this meeting.",1
"However, risks of rising demand-side inflationary pressures must be monitored.",-1
Headline inflation is projected to decline.,1
"Meanwhile, merchandise exports will slow down this year but are expected to improve in 2024 in line with the global economic recovery.",0
"However, there is a risk that core inflation would remain high for longer than expected owing to a potential increase in pass-through given elevated costs.",-1
The Committee is ready to adjust the size and timing of policy normalization should the growth and inflation outlook shift from the current assessment.,0
The Committee will therefore continue to closely monitor risks to inflation.,0
Such improvements will support the continued expansion of private consumption.,1
"However, the financial positions of some SMEs and households remain fragile and sensitive to the rising living costs and debt burden.",-1
"Nevertheless, the Committee will continue to closely monitor developments in the financial market and volatilities in the foreign exchange market.",0
"The Committee votes unanimously to raise the policy rate by 0.25 percentage point from 1.25 to 1.50 percent, effective immediately.",0
Core inflation is expected to remain at a high level for some time before gradually decreasing.,-1
The tourism sector will exhibit a faster recovery following the return of Chinese tourists.,1
Funding costs have risen in tandem with the policy rate increases as well as the expiration of reduction in the Financial Institutions Development Fund (FIDF) contribution.,-1
The baht against the US dollar has appreciated owing to expectations of a less aggressive tightening of the Fed as well as China’s relaxation of international travel restrictions which would benefit the Thai tourism sector.,1
"Meanwhile, growth of merchandise exports will moderate this year, but is expected to resume in 2024 in tandem with global growth which is projected to bottom out in 2023.",0
The Thai economy will continue to gain traction with continued recovery in tourism and private consumption thanks to the return of Chinese tourists.,1
Overall financial system remains resilient.,1
The policy rate should be normalized to the level that is consistent with sustainable growth in the long term in a gradual and measured manner.,0
"Under the monetary policy framework with objectives of maintaining price stability, supporting sustainable and full-potential economic growth, and preserving financial stability, the Committee judges that Thai economic recovery remains on track.",1
The Committee views that financial institutions should continue to press ahead with debt restructuring and deems it important to have targeted measures and sustainable solutions in place for vulnerable groups.,1
The Thai economy is projected to continue growing.,1
Commercial banks maintain high levels of capital and loan loss provision.,1
"Moreover, the tourism recovery could increase demand-side inflationary pressures.",-1
"Disyatat, Secretary of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), announced the outcome of the meeting on 25 January 2023 as follows.",0
"This will contribute to a more broad-based improvement in employment and income of services sector and self-employed workers, which account a significant share of total employment.",1
Supply-side inflationary pressures will continue to dissipate along with a decline in global energy and commodity prices.,1
"Meanwhile, medium-term inflation expectations remain anchored within the target range.",1
Overall financial conditions are less accommodative.,-1
"However, bank lending and bond issuances continue to increase.",1
Debt serviceability of households and businesses has improved in line with the economic recovery.,1
"Headline inflation is expected to decline, whereas core inflation remains at a high level with increased risks from demand-side inflationary pressures due to the economic recovery.",0
The Committee assesses that downside risks to the global economy have decreased given the improving outlook in both advanced economies and China.,1
The Committee thus voted to maintain the policy rate at this meeting to preserve the limited policy space to act at the appropriate and most effective timing.,0
The Committee viewed that procurement and distribution of vaccines in an adequate and timely manner was the most important issue for the Thai economy at the present.,0
"Significant risks to the Thai economy in the period ahead included (1) the distribution and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccination, (2) uneven recovery across economic sectors resulting in a more vulnerable labor market which would affect household income and private consumption, and (3) more fragile financial positions, particularly among SMEs and tourism businesses that had lower debt servicing capability in line with lower incomes; while household savings as a share of income declined and reduced capability to cushion expenses.",-1
"Under the monetary policy framework with objectives of maintaining price stability, supporting sustainable and full-potential economic growth, and preserving financial stability, the Committee continued to emphasize supporting the economic recovery.",1
Medium-term inflation expectations remained anchored within the target.,1
"-2- Despite ample overall liquidity and low financing costs, the distribution of liquidity remained uneven due to increased credit risks.",-1
"However, the impact on the overall labor market would be limited.",0
"Mallikamas, Secretary of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), announced the outcome of the meeting on 5 May 2021 as follows.",0
"Regarding financial measures, the most important one would be the distribution of liquidity to the businesses and households additionally affected by the new outbreak.",0
"In addition, the recovery of foreign tourist figures would be affected by the longer-than-expected delay in the re-opening of the country and the uncertain international travel restriction measures.",-1
The Committee viewed that the continuity of government measures and policy coordination among government agencies would be critical to support the economic recovery impacted by the new outbreak.,1
The Committee would stand ready to use additional appropriate monetary policy tools if necessary.,0
"The main driving force of the economy would be merchandise exports, which improved in line with the expansion of trading partner economies.",1
"In addition, the Committee would monitor key factors to the economic outlook, namely the new outbreak, the distribution and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines, and the adequacy of government measures as well as financial and credit measures.",0
Credit expansion thus needed to be more broadbased after the commencement of the special loan facility for businesses.,0
The Bank of Thailand would closely monitor the progress and assess the efficacy of financial and credit measures.,0
"Meanwhile, the government’s relief and financial measures additionally announced would partly support the economic recovery in the short term.",1
The Committee assessed that the Thai economy would expand at a much lower rate due to the third wave of the COVID-19 outbreak which affected domestic spending and the recovery of foreign tourist figures.,-1
The Thai economy would expand at a much lower rate due to the third wave of the outbreak which affected domestic spending.,-1
The measures to accelerate the procurement and distribution of vaccines would prevent the outbreak from being prolonged.,1
"In particularly, credit measures and expedited debt restructuring would reduce financial burden in a more targeted manner than cutting the policy rate, which was already at a low level and remained supportive of economic recovery.",1
"The new financial rehabilitation measures to support business recovery post- COVID- 19 should accelerate the distribution of liquidity to the affected groups in a targeted manner, reduce debt burden, and support the economic recovery.",1
"Fiscal measures should ensure the continuity of fiscal impulses, mitigate the impacts of the outbreak, and support the economic restoration going forward.",1
Headline inflation would temporarily increase in the second quarter of 2021 due to the low level of crude oil prices in the same quarter of last year.,0
"Nevertheless, fiscal stimulus for fiscal year 2022 would decrease somewhat owing to the expedition of budget disbursement under the Emergency Decree Authorizing the Ministry of Finance to Raise Loans to Solve Problems, to Remedy and Restore the Economy and Society as Affected by the Coronavirus Disease Pandemic, BE 2563 (2020) that was front-loaded to the current fiscal year.",-1
Monetary policy must remain accommodative.,1
The Committee voted unanimously to maintain the policy rate at 0.50 percent.,0
"On exchange rates, the Thai baht depreciated against the US dollar relatively more than regional currencies.",-1
"In addition, financial institutions should accelerate debt restructuring.",0
Long-term government bond yields gradually declined from the previous period.,1
The Committee would closely monitor developments in both the global and domestic financial markets and continue to expedite the new foreign exchange ecosystem.,0
"Despite ample overall liquidity and low financing costs, the distribution of liquidity remained uneven due to increased credit risks.",-1
"This was a result of more fragile financial positions, particularly for businesses that experienced slow recovery and households that were additionally affected by the recent outbreak.",-1
"Significant risks included the efficacy and distribution of COVID-19 vaccination, the recovery in foreign tourist figures, and the continuity of fiscal support.",-1
The Committee therefore voted to maintain the policy rate at this meeting to preserve the limited policy space to act at the appropriate and most effective timing.,0
"The Committee assessed that the Thai economy continued to expand, but downside risks and uncertainties surrounding the economic outlook remained high in the period ahead.",-1
Headline inflation was projected to return to the target in the middle of 2021 and would stay close to the lower bound of the target range throughout the forecast period.,1
The Committee voted unanimously to maintain the policy rate at 0.50 percent to support the economic recovery which remained highly uncertain.,0
"The Committee would monitor the adequacy of the government measures and various risks, especially the outbreak situation in Thailand and abroad, in deliberating monetary policy going forward.",0
Long-term government bond yields rose in tandem with US Treasury yields.,0
"In addition, the government should simultaneously implement supply-side policies to support business restructuring and upskilling of labor, which would help support sustainable economic recovery in the long term.",1
"The financial system remained sound despite vulnerabilities in some segments due to the negative shocks from the recent COVID-19 outbreak, particularly lowincome households and SMEs.",0
"On exchange rates, the Thai baht depreciated against the US dollar in line with regional currencies.",1
"Nonetheless, the recovery would remain uneven across economic sectors.",-1
Monetary policy must remain accommodative.,1
"The Thai economy was projected to expand by 3.0 and 4.7 percent in 2021 and 2022 respectively, somewhat lower than the previous projection in line with lower tourist figures and the impacts of the new wave of the COVID-19 outbreak.",0
Medium-term inflation expectations remained anchored within the target.,1
The economy would thus need support from the continued low policy rate.,0
"Mallikamas, Secretary of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), announced the outcome of the meeting on 24 March 2021 as follows.",0
The Committee would stand ready to use additional appropriate monetary policy tools if necessary.,0
The Committee viewed that the continuity of government measures and policy coordination among government agencies would be critical to support the economic recovery going forward.,1
"While financial institutions should accelerate debt restructuring, fiscal measures must continue to sustain the economy.",0
"The Committee encouraged the expedition of the new financial rehabilitation measures to support business recovery post-COVID-19 to ensure distribution of liquidity to the affected groups in a targeted manner, reduce debt burden, and support the economic transformation in the period ahead.",1
"In particular, the government should expedite budget disbursement under the restoration plan once the new wave of the outbreak become well contained.",1
"Under the monetary policy framework with objectives of maintaining price stability, supporting sustainable and full-potential economic growth, and preserving financial stability, the Committee continued to emphasize supporting the economic recovery.",1
"However, the economy would be supported by a fast recovery in merchandise exports, which was in line with the expansion of trading partner economies, as well as the economic stimulus measures additionally announced.",1
"The Committee would closely monitor developments in the financial markets and assess their implications on the recovery in the period ahead, as well as continue to expedite the new foreign exchange ecosystem.",0
"Disyatat, Secretary of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), announced the outcome of the meeting on 29 March 2023 as follows.",0
"Headline inflation would likely return to the target range in the middle of the year, but core inflation remains elevated with upside risks from higher cost pass-through and demand pressures.",-1
The Committee is prepared to adjust the size and timing of policy normalization should the evolving growth and inflation outlook differ from the current assessment.,0
"The Committee projects the economic growth to be 3.6 and 3.8 percent in 2023 and 2024, respectively.",1
The Committee agrees that financial institutions should continue to press ahead with debt restructuring and deems it important to have in place targeted measures and sustainable debt resolution for vulnerable groups.,1
"However, as the situation remains fluid and uncertain, there is a need to closely monitor the developments and continuously assess potential impact on Thailand’s financial stability.",-1
"On balance, financial conditions are supportive of the ongoing recovery and mobilization of funds by the private sector.",1
"The Thai economy should continue to expand, driven mainly by tourism and private consumption.",1
The Committee is closely monitoring developments in the financial market and any impact on the domestic financial market including the exchange rate.,0
"The Committee deems a continuation of gradual policy normalization to be appropriate in light of the growth and inflation outlook, and voted to raise the policy rate by 0.25 percentage point at this meeting.",1
"However, persistently high inflation remains a risk, as producers could pass on higher costs absorbed in the past and demand-side pressures could pick up as the recovery gains traction.",-1
The Committee thus decided to increase the policy interest rate to normalize the monetary policy stance in a gradual and measured manner toward a level consistent with long-term sustainable growth.,1
"In view of these objectives, the Committee judges the broad contour of economic recovery to be on track with some upside risks to inflation stemming from demand pressures.",0
"A key impetus is the broad-based recovery in tourism, which should promote employment and labor income, in turn sustaining private consumption.",1
"Easing supply-side pressures, notably from electricity and oil prices, are key contributing factors.",1
"Meanwhile, merchandise exports show signs of rebounding after contracting at the end of last year, and should gather momentum in the second half of this year.",1
"The baht continues to fluctuate against the US dollar, driven by the Federal Reserve’s uncertain policy outlook and financial market volatility induced by banking stresses in advanced economies.",-1
The Committee will continue to closely monitor price developments.,0
"As for households and businesses, the ongoing economic recovery has improved debt serviceability.",1
Financial fragilities nonetheless remain for some SMEs and certain households exposed to rising living costs and higher debt burden.,-1
"Core inflation is projected to fall to 2.4 and 2.0 percent in 2023 and 2024, respectively.",1
Exports of goods are recovering and expected to gain strength in the second half of this year.,1
"Under the prevailing monetary policy framework, the Committee seeks to maintain price stability, support sustainable growth in line with potential, and preserve financial stability.",0
"Recent banking stresses in some advanced economies have not had a significant impact on the Thai financial system, as Thai financial institutions and corporations have limited linkages with the troubled banks and risky assets.",1
"Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, tightening somewhat from higher private sector funding costs consistent with the policy interest rate.",0
The overall financial system remains resilient.,1
"However, the global economic uncertainty has increased, in part from persistent inflationary pressures and episodes of banking stresses in advanced economies.",-1
"Headline inflation would likely return to the target range by mid-2023, and is projected to decline to 2.9 and 2.4 percent in 2023 and 2024, respectively.",1
"The Committee voted unanimously to raise the policy rate by 0.25 percentage point from 1.50 to 1.75 percent, effective immediately.",0
"However, persistently high inflation and banking stresses in some advanced economies pose risks to the global economic outlook.",-1
"Moreover, financial institutions maintain high levels of capital and loan loss provision.",1
The Committee voted unanimously to maintain the policy rate at 0.50 percent to support the economic recovery which remained highly uncertain.,-1
Headline inflation was projected to return to the target in the middle of 2021 and would stay close to the lower bound of the target range throughout the forecast period.,1
Monetary policy must remain accommodative.,0
The Committee assessed that the impact of the recent outbreak on the Thai economy would be less severe than last year due to less strict containment measures.,1
"At a longer horizon, it would depend on (1) the recovery in foreign tourist figures, (2) efficacy and coverage of COVID-19 vaccination, (3) continued and sufficient fiscal support, and (4) the labor market situation, which became more fragile as the numbers of unemployed and underemployed workers were expected to rise in the short term.",-1
"The Committee would closely monitor developments of the baht, consider -2- the necessity of implementing additional appropriate measures, and continue to expedite the new foreign exchange ecosystem.",0
"Nevertheless, uncertainties surrounding the economic outlook remained high with considerable downside risks.",-1
"Furthermore, recoveries across economic sectors were likely to be more uneven which would affect the sustainability of the economic growth going forward.",-1
"In particular, the government should expedite budget disbursement under the restoration plan once the new wave of the outbreak become well contained.",1
"Financial and credit measures should expedite liquidity distribution to the affected groups in a targeted and timely manner, for instance, through credit guarantee schemes in order to curb credit risks, while financial institutions should accelerate debt restructuring to have a broader impact.",1
The movement of the baht against the US dollar was in line with regional currencies.,0
"Under the monetary policy framework with objectives of maintaining price stability, supporting sustainable and full-potential economic growth, and preserving financial stability, the Committee continued to emphasize supporting the economic recovery.",1
Other additional measures should also be considered to increase the effectiveness of liquidity distribution and to support the economic recovery going forward.,1
"Nonetheless, the recovery prospect remained highly uncertain, which would in the short term depend mainly on the situation of the new wave of the COVID-19 outbreak and corresponding containment measures.",-1
"The Committee assessed that, while the new wave of the COVID-19 outbreak and the containment measures would affect the Thai economy in the short term, the economic recovery continued to be on track thanks to government measures and export recovery.",1
Fiscal measures must continue to sustain the economy.,0
"In particular, low-income households and SMEs became more vulnerable.",-1
"Mallikamas, Secretary of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), announced the outcome of the meeting on 3 February 2021 as follows.",0
The financial system remained sound despite increasing vulnerabilities in some segments due to the negative shocks from the recent outbreak.,0
"The Committee would monitor the adequacy of the government measures and various risks, especially the outbreak situation in Thailand and abroad, in deliberating monetary policy going forward.",0
Additional support from the timely and targeted government measures together with the export recovery would support economic growth.,1
The Committee therefore voted to maintain the policy rate at this meeting to preserve the limited policy space to act at the appropriate and most effective timing.,0
"Besides, the government should simultaneously implement supply-side policies to support business restructuring and upskilling of labor, which would help support sustainable economic recovery in the long term.",1
Mediumterm inflation expectations remained anchored within the target.,1
The economy would thus need support from the continued low policy rate.,0
"Despite ample overall liquidity and low financing costs, the distribution of liquidity remained uneven due to increased credit risks.",-1
"This was a result of more fragile financial positions, particularly for businesses that experienced slow recovery and households that were additionally affected by the recent outbreak.",-1
The Committee thus expected the economy to expand somewhat lower than the previous forecast.,-1
The Committee would stand ready to use additional appropriate monetary policy tools if necessary.,0
The Committee viewed that the continuity of government measures and policy coordination among government agencies would be critical to support the economic recovery going forward.,1
"Nevertheless, financial fragilities remain for some SMEs and households that are exposed to rising living costs and higher debt burden.",-1
"Merchandise exports are recovering broadly consistent with expectation, and should improve in line with a moderate expansion in the global economic activity.",1
Financial institutions maintain high levels of capital and loan loss provision.,1
"Disyatat, Secretary of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), announced the outcome of the meeting on 31 May 2023 as follows.",0
The Committee thus decided to increase the policy interest rate to normalize the monetary policy stance in a gradual and measured manner toward a level consistent with long-term sustainable growth.,1
"A key impetus is the broad-based recovery in tourism, which should promote employment and labor income, in turn sustaining private consumption.",1
"At the same time, there is a need to monitor the uncertain economic and monetary policy outlook of major economies.",-1
"Headline inflation returned to the target range and is projected to be 2.5 and 2.4 percent in 2023 and 2024, respectively, due to easing electricity and oil prices.",1
"The Committee voted unanimously to raise the policy rate by 0.25 percentage point from 1.75 to 2.00 percent, effective immediately.",0
Inflationary risks stem from greater demand pressures amid expanding economic activity and higher cost pass-through from supply pressures.,-1
"Upside inflationary risks exist from greater demand pressures amid expanding economic activity and higher cost passthrough from supply pressures, in part contingent on government economic policies looking ahead.",-1
The overall financial system remains resilient.,1
Inflation should continue to decline at a gradual pace.,1
"The baht depreciated against the US dollar, in part influenced by the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy outlook, the renminbi depreciation and domestic political uncertainties.",-1
"In the view of these objectives, the Committee expects a steady economic expansion but sees a need to monitor upside risks to inflation.",0
"As a result, there is a need to monitor the price-setting behavior of businesses.",0
Mechandise exports are expected to recover gradually.,1
Debt serviceability of households and businesses has improved in tandem with the economic recovery.,1
The Committee is prepared to adjust the size and timing of policy normalization should the evolving growth and inflation outlook differ from the current assessment.,0
"The Committee projects the economic growth to be 3.6 and 3.8 percent in 2023 and 2024, respectively.",1
Current financial conditions nonetheless remain supportive of the ongoing recovery and mobilization of funds by the private sector.,1
The Committee is closely monitoring financial market developments and volatilities.,0
"The Thai economy should continue to expand, driven mainly by tourism and private consumption.",1
Overall financial conditions turned somewhat less accommodative owing to higher private sector funding cost consistent with the policy interest rate.,0
The Committee agrees that financial institutions should continue to press ahead with debt restructing and deems it important to have in place targeted measures and sustainable debt resolution for vulnerable groups.,1
"Under the prevailing monetary policy framework, the Committee seeks to maintain price stability, support sustainable growth in line with potential, and preserve financial stability.",1
"While headline inflation slows, core inflation remains elevated.",0
"The Committee recognizes upside risks to domestic growth, in part owing to forthcoming government economic policies.",1
"Moreover, core inflation is projected to stabilize at 2.0 percent in 2023 and 2024, an elevated level relative to the past.",0
"The Committee deems a continuation of gradual policy normalization to be appropriate in light of the growth and inflation outlook, and voted to raise the policy rate by 0.25 percentage point at this meeting.",0
"The Committee viewed that the continued accommodative monetary policy would help support overall economic growth, and thus voted to maintain the policy rate.",1
"In addition, the ongoing financial and fiscal measures, with the focus on rebuilding and enhancing potential growth, would play an important part in bolstering the robust recovery of income.",1
"Meanwhile, the spread of the Omicron variant would be a key risk to the economic outlook and therefore warranted close monitoring.",-1
"Meanwhile, the recovery in various business sectors was expected to improve in line with economic activities.",1
"Disyatat, Secretary of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), announced the outcome of the meeting on 22 December 2021 as follows.",0
"Nevertheless, the Committee assessed that headline inflation would be subject to upside risks given higher global inflation and thus warranted close monitoring.",-1
The impact could be more severe and prolonged than expected due to downside risks such as the severity of the outbreak and the strictness of corresponding containment measures.,-1
"However, there remained a need to monitor the labor market recovery, especially with regard to employment and income which were still below pre-pandemic levels.",-1
Monetary policy should contribute to continued accommodative financial conditions overall.,1
The Committee would stand ready to use additional appropriate monetary policy tools if necessary.,0
"Inflation was expected to remain within the target in the medium term, with headline inflation projection at 1.2, 1.7, and 1.4 percent in 2021, 2022, and 2023, respectively.",1
The Committee assessed that the Thai economy would continue to recover.,1
"In addition, financial institutions should accelerate debt consolidation and debt restructuring in a sustainable manner through the scheme launched on September 3, 2021 to have broader impacts and be consistent with borrowers’ long-term debt serviceability.",1
"Overall liquidity remained ample, but credit risks continued to pose a challenge to liquidity distribution, particularly to SMEs.",0
The Committee viewed that the government measures and policy coordination among government agencies would be critical to support the economic recovery.,1
"These measures included the special loan facility, asset warehousing scheme, and other measures by specialized financial institutions (SFIs).",1
The likelihood of second-round effects remained low due to limited cost pass-through given the slow economic recovery as well as weak employment and labor income.,-1
Financial and credit measures should be expedited to distribute liquidity to the affected groups in a targeted manner and help reduce debt burden.,1
The Committee assessed that the Omicron outbreak would affect the economy in early 2022.,-1
Public health measures should strike a balance between containing the outbreak and supporting the recovery of economic activities.,0
The Committee voted unanimously to maintain the policy rate at 0.50 percent.,0
"In addition, the Committee would monitor key factors affecting the economic outlook, namely mutations of COVID-19 virus, adequacy of fiscal, financial, and credit measures, and higher cost pass-through.",0
Government bond yields were mostly unchanged.,0
"Fiscal measures should support the economic recovery in a targeted manner, with a focus on generating income and expediting measures to rebuild and enhance potential growth.",1
"The Committee expected that the Thai economy would grow 0.9 percent in 2021 and would continue to expand 3.4 and 4.7 percent in 2022 and 2023, respectively, driven by domestic spending and a gradual improvement in foreign tourist figures.",1
"Under the monetary policy framework with objectives of maintaining price stability, supporting sustainable and full-potential economic growth, and preserving financial stability, the Committee continued to put emphasis on supporting the economic recovery.",1
"The Committee would closely monitor developments in both global and domestic financial markets, and continue to expedite the new foreign exchange ecosystem, particularly through supporting SMEs in hedging against risks from exchange rate volatility.",0
"On exchange rates, the volatility of the baht relative to the US dollar remained high due to uncertainties surrounding the COVID-19 situation which could escalate as well as monetary policy in advanced economies amid high inflationary pressures.",-1
"Headline inflation increased temporarily mainly due to energy prices, but there remained a need to monitor developments of global inflation and cost pass-through.",0
"Headline inflation increased temporarily due to supply-side factors, particularly energy prices, which were expected to subside in the second half of 2022.",0
"There is a need to continue monitoring credit quality for some SMEs and households with impaired debt serviceability, higher debt burden, and slower income recovery.",-1
Financial institutions maintain high levels of capital and loan loss provision.,1
"With output continuing to recover toward potential, the Committee deems the current policy interest rate conducive to keeping inflation sustainably within the target range, fostering long-term macro-financial stability by preempting the buildup of financial imbalances, and ensuring sufficient policy space in light of uncertain outlook.",1
"Under the prevailing monetary policy framework, the Committee seeks to maintain price stability, support sustainable growth, and preserve financial stability.",1
The Committee voted unanimously to maintain the policy rate at 2.50 percent.,0
The lower headline inflation this year owes in part to the last-year high base as well as temporary factors such as energy price subsidies and lower-than-expected raw food prices.,0
"Disyatat, Secretary of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), announced the outcome of the meeting on 29 November 2023 as follows.",0
"The baht strengthened against the US dollar in line with the regional currencies, primarily influenced by the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy outlook.",1
"The growth projection that accounts for the government’s digital wallet scheme is 3.8 percent in 2024, compared with the previous assessment of 4.4 percent.",-1
"The projection that accounts for the digital wallet scheme is 2.2 percent in 2024, relative to the previous assessment of 2.6 percent.",-1
The Committee is attentive to risks from higher food prices due to El Niño and a potential increase in global energy prices arising from the Middle East conflicts.,-1
Overall financial conditions tightened somewhat.,-1
The current policy interest rate is appropriate for supporting long-term sustainable growth.,1
Private sector funding costs increased in line with the higher policy rate but in general do not hinder the ongoing economic recovery.,1
"In view of these objectives, the Committee expects the Thai economy to gradually recover toward its potential, and inflation to be within the target range.",1
"At the same time, structural impediments could limit the positive effects of global demand recovery on Thai exports.",-1
"Merchandise exports and tourism have been recovering more slowly than expected, due to subdued growth in China and a delayed turnaround in global electronic demand.",-1
"Headline inflation is projected to stay within the target range, at 1.3 and 2.0 percent in 2023 and 2024, respectively.",1
The Committee will take into account growth and inflation outlook as well as associated risks in deliberating monetary policy looking ahead.,0
"The Thai economy overall continued to recover, despite some slowdown in merchandise exports and related production.",1
"The Committee projects growth of 2.4 and 3.2 percent in 2023 and 2024, respectively.",1
Inflation should increase next year in line with the economic recovery and El Niño-related supply pressure.,0
The Committee thus voted to maintain the policy rate at this meeting.,0
One MPC member was unable to attend the meeting.,0
"The Committee supports the continuation of debt restructuring measures as well as targeted measures and sustainable debt resolution for vulnerable groups, particularly responsible lending measures.",1
The overall financial system remains resilient.,1
"Looking ahead, growth should be more balanced, as tourism continues to recover and merchandise exports start to expand.",1
"Growth is expected to be more balanced in 2024 and 2025, supported by domestic demand, tourism sector, and a recovery in merchandise exports.",1
"The broad trajectory of the economy is one of a continued recovery, driven by a robust expansion in private consumption on the back of services spending as well as an improvement in employment and labor income.",1
Business loan growth has begun stabilising in line with economic activities.,0
"Meanwhile, core inflation excluding the digital wallet scheme is expected to be 1.3 and 1.2 percent in 2023 and 2024, respectively.",0
